Why learning compilers is important:
https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html
- phases of compilers
 1. parsing: text -> abstract syntax tree (AST)
    - text -> |lexical analysis| -> tokens -> |syntactoc analysis| -> AST
 2. type checking/determination
 3. code geneeration (compiling)
    - generation of the lower level instructions/code
